                        About this project The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser
                        is a sturdy and stylish platform that elevates your
                        screen to a more comfortable viewing height. Placing
                        your monitor at eye level has the potential to improve
                        your posture and make you more comfortable while at
                        work, helping you stay focused on the task at hand.
                        Featuring artisan craftsmanship, the simplicity of
                        design creates extra desk space below your computer to
                        allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks to be stored under
                        the stand.
